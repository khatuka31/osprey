Changelog
=========

v1.2.0dev
---------

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
+ ``n_folds`` and ``n_iter`` parameters have been renamed to ``n_splits`` to
  conform to the ``sklearn`` API.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Added support for ``TimeSeriesSplit`` and ``LeavePOut`` cross-validators.
+ Improved ``osprey dump`` JSON output. The hyperparameters for each run are now stored along all
  the other settings in the same dictionary, allowing for subsequent easier loading and plotting.
+ Added ``max_param_suggestion_retries`` entry to the config file. This limits the number of times that
  ``strategy.suggest`` is called when attempting to produce a trial with a set of params not previously
  tested in the history. 
+ Added ``n_jobs`` flag for ``osprey worker`` to control how many threads are
  used for cross-validation.
+ Added ability to specifiy arbitrary kernels for gaussian process strategy.
+ Added the ability to specify three different acquisition functions for the gaussian processes strategy: expected
improvement `ei`, upper confidence bound, `ucb` and the original Osprey function (the default), `osprey`.


Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
+ Fixed issue that was causing crashes when there was an attempt to write estimator parameters (e.g. numpy arrays) which
couldn't be serialized by JSON.
+ Fixed crashes when using ``jump`` variables of type ``int``.
+ Fixed error in the way integer variables were selected from results of Gaussian processes search strategy.
